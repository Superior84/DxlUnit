# DxlUnit - The Test Framework for IBM Rational DOORS script language DXL

Here it is:

Comming from object oriented languages, the most I missed in 2010 on DXL was a test framework like JUnit or NUnit.

So I started in 2010 to develop my own one and used it throughout plenty of projects, before I decided to make it open source. Due to this long period of time the first version offered is 2.8.

For those who are not familiar with test frameworks and to get an overview of this framework, have a look at the presentation inside the Testframework folder 'Test Driven Development in DXL.pptx'.

To get a deeper understanding you will also find a HTML help file explaining in more detail the concepts of a test framework and the realisation and usage inside the DxlUnit Testframwork.

**Features:**
- Run single or all tests in an own GUI:

- Run all tests inside IBM Doors DXL Interaction

- Run tests inside DxlEditor

**Planned:**
- implement keyword to ignore tests if running without users interface
- log results to file, to be able to run the tests inside a batch routine

Hope you enjoy it
